# NTNU Cybernetics and robotics student

This page contains a collection of school related projects that I have worked on
through my masters degree in Cybernetics and robotics at NTNU. It was created to
keep my personal projects and my school work in separate workspaces on Github.

To check out my other projects you can go to [vegar Karlsen](https://github.com/vegarkarlsen) :)
